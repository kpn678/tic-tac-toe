## Overview
This version of **Tic-Tac-Toe** is a fresh, floral take on the classic game, just in time for spring to blossom. Two players will duke it out to connect three of their tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in a 3x3 grid. In most cases, one player will prevail, but who knows, maybe a draw is in the cards!

#### Goals
- To make a personalized, functional version of the provided comp by expanding upon current HTML and CSS knowledge
- To implement DRY JavaScript (JS) wherein the DOM and data model are separated
- To effectively manage time and the problem solving process

## Reflections
This project definitely tested the limits of what I have been learning in class. There were moments when I felt overwhelmed and had no idea where to begin. In the end, planning out each day, but being flexible when I did not get as much done as I wanted (I lost a lot of work time dealing with the stomach flu), while also knowing when to reach out for help, made this process manageable for me. I am proud of the work I produced. For future directions, local storage is something that I would implement to have the game counter and wins persist. There is also a lot of potential to make the CSS a lot more fun and interactive, and I would love to delve into that. Overall, this was a rough but valuable learning experience.
